Hi 👋 My name is Dhruv Rastogi
=============================

### Software Engineer

I’m a Software Engineer with a B.Tech in Computer Science, experienced in building **end-to-end software systems** across web, Android, and backend platforms. I enjoy working close to real production problems—designing APIs, building user-facing applications, integrating services, and shipping features that actually get used.

I’ve worked as an intern at a multinational company, collaborating with cross-functional teams and contributing to production codebases. My academic and personal projects span **full-stack web apps, Android applications, and applied machine learning**, reflecting strong problem-solving skills, curiosity, and the ability to learn quickly.

I’m comfortable moving across the stack—from backend services and databases to modern frontend frameworks—while writing clean, maintainable code and following sound engineering practices. Outside work, I explore new domains through side projects, competitive programming, and continuous learning, aiming to grow into a well-rounded engineer capable of owning products end to end.
